This project was my first C++ project with the Win32API

I tested many new things which where unknown to me before, examples inculude:
	SAL language (not sure if I used it correctly), [[noreturn]] (I am not using [[noreturn]] anymore because it caused a lot of trouble with undefined behaviours (function was indirectly returning something (operator=)))
	Hexadecimal instead of decimal (not sure if it makes the code faster or more readable. Some say that an integer can store greater values in hex but I expected the compiler to automatically convert it to hex)
	A text file including a summary of what I've learned (this file)
	"Propper" documentation (not sure if everything is written correctly, e.g. IntelliSense displays the * in the docstring if I didn't provide it with any @param/@returns...)
	New lines for parameters in declaration (not sure where to put override, const...)
	Variadic template arguments (not sure if they were necessary, @see Calculator::Application::AddWidget())
